Goals: 

- creating a stylesheet to be used in tilemill, to browse neighborhoods. 

This will be forked one day. 

1. convert the OSM file to a shapefile 
2. if not, then download the old one from cloudmade 
3. then find, somewhere, I forget, that for cloudmade extracts, you have to do something to the files before they work in tilemill, 
[wait, why is the stylesheet, highway.mss for open-streets-dc a lot different than one on open-streets [github page] ?
